This code was based off the http://socket.io/get-started/chat/ 
I also referred to MDN Web Docs and w3schools for help in terms of method calls and all.

In order to run this code, download all files to computer.
Make sure that node.js and npm are installed.
Go to the file directory and open a terminal.
Type node index.js to start server.
Connect to server from localhost:3000.
